uestions on Functions:

1. Write a function is_prime(num) that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, otherwise False.

2. Create a function count_vowels(string) that accepts a string and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string, considering both uppercase and lowercase.

3. Write a function reverse_string(s) that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed without using slicing ([::-1]).
4. Implement a function factoria

4. Implement a function factorial(num) that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

5. Write a function calculate_area(shape, *dimensions) that calculates the area of a given shape (circle, rectangle, triangle). 
   - If shape is "circle", it should take one argument (radius).  
   - If shape is "rectangle", it should take two arguments (length, width)
